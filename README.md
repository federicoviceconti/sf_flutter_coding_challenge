Welcome,

If you made it here odds are you're beeing selected as the next **Starting Finance's Flutter
Engineer**!

Just one last step is required: To complete the almighty...

# SF FLUTTER CODING CHALLENGE

In this challenge you will work with Coincap's Rest APIs to develop a Crypto Wallet.

Let's assume that our user (you!), has opened positions on many cryptos: One BTC, some ETH, A bunch
of DOGEs... you get the point.
> A position is the amount of a security, asset, or property that is owned (or sold short) by some individual or other entity.


Your Goal is to develop an APP that contains a **Crypto Wallet** (You will find a mockup at the end
of this page), showing information about those positions:

* Cryptos' prices and variations (in US Dollars);
* Wallet's total value (in US Dollars);
* Whatever you want, feel free to enrich the page with your personal touch (eg. charts).

Features:

* Wallet's and positions' value must always have the latest price (in polling);
* The UI must be scalable, capable of handling many positions.

## Step 1

Get yourself an API Key from [Coincap](https://docs.coincap.io/).

## Step 2

Get yourself the latest [flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) version.

## Step 3

Fork this repo and start coding!

### MOCKUP

> You will find Starting Finance's logo among the assets.
